Simple task to teach myself something about CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

## Objective
Train model on 4k images of cats and 4k images of dogs. Use simple and well known model: AlexNet and create custom
nn.Module based on this architecture.

Enter my own dog photo and log correctly predicted class.

Training params:
loss: CrossEntropyLoss 
learning rate: 0.0001 (1e-4)
optimizer: AdamW (Adaptive Moment Estimation With Decoupled Weight Decay)
number of epochs = 40
